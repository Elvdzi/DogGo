# DogGo


A prototype for an application that helps dog owners keep their dog physically active, whilst also providing support for finding new routes to take when walking the dog. Aids both the dog owners to create a strong relationship with their dog and keep their dog healthy by allowing users to track how long they walk their dog and how much they should walk their dog, as well as finding new and interesting routes to take.

The prototype was created using Figma.
